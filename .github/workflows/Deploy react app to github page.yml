Create a new GitHub Actions workflow file to automate the deployment of the React application to GitHub Pages.

## Workflow File
Create a new file `.github/workflows/deploy-react.yml` with the following content:

```yaml
name: Deploy React App to GitHub Pages

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  workflow_dispatch:

permissions:
  contents: read
  pages: write
  id-token: write

concurrency:
  group: "pages"
  cancel-in-progress: false

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
      
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '18'
          cache: 'npm'
      
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci
      
      - name: Build
        run: npm run build
      
      - name: Setup Pages
        uses: actions/configure-pages@v4
      
      - name: Upload artifact
        uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3
        with:
          path: './build'

  deploy:
    environment:
      name: github-pages
      url: ${{ steps.deployment.outputs.page_url }}
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: build
    steps:
      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        id: deployment
        uses: actions/deploy-pages@v4
```

## Implementation Details:
1. The workflow will run on:
   - Push to the `main` branch
   - Manual trigger through workflow_dispatch

2. Required permissions are set for:
   - contents: read
   - pages: write
   - id-token: write

3. Workflow includes two jobs:
   - `build`: Builds the React application
   - `deploy`: Deploys the built application to GitHub Pages

4. The workflow uses latest versions of official GitHub Actions:
   - actions/checkout@v4
   - actions/setup-node@v4
   - actions/configure-pages@v4
   - actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3
   - actions/deploy-pages@v4

## Prerequisites:
1. Repository must have GitHub Pages enabled
2. Node.js project with a build script configured in package.json
3. Dependencies properly listed in package.json

## Note:
The workflow assumes the build output is in the './build' directory. If your React app builds to a different directory, update the `path` in the Upload artifact step accordingly.
